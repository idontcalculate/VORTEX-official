# VORTEX-Official

**VORTEX-Official** is a streamlined Rust library designed for the conversion of machine learning models into the VORTEX format, a highly efficient and portable format optimized for seamless deployment across diverse systems. By focusing on model structure and metadata, VORTEX-Official enables the deployment of lightweight models that omit raw weights and biases, avoiding the need for cumbersome wrapper methods.

## Key Features

- The `.vortex` format can act as a container to store not just model weights but also metadata, configuration, or other elements relevant to your use case.
- If your deployment process or target environment requires a specific structure that isn’t covered by standard formats, the `.vortex` format can encapsulate your model and its associated data in a way that fits those needs.-
- The `.vortex` format includes custom versioning or tagging to help manage different versions of your models in a structured manner.

## Installation

To get started with VORTEX-Official, ensure Rust is installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and build the project using Cargo, Rust’s package manager. This straightforward setup ensures that you can quickly integrate VORTEX-Official into your workflow.

### Model Conversion

The core functionality of VORTEX-Official revolves around converting machine learning models into the VORTEX format. Once your model is saved in a compatible format (like a PyTorch checkpoint), you can convert it to a `.vortex` file. This file can then be used across various platforms, benefiting from its lightweight and portable nature.

### Integration and Deployment

VORTEX-Official is designed to integrate seamlessly into your existing systems, making it easier to deploy models in production environments. The generated `.vortex` files can be stored, versioned, and loaded as needed, ensuring that your deployment pipeline remains efficient and scalable.

## Project Structure

The project is organized to facilitate ease of use and extension:

- **`src/main.rs`**: The entry point of the application, coordinating the conversion process.
- **`src/convert_to_vortex.rs`**: Core logic that handles the conversion of models to the VORTEX format.
- **`src/vortex_model.rs`**: Definitions for the VortexModel and VortexLayer structs, which form the backbone of the VORTEX format.
- **`src/config.rs`**: Manages configuration, enabling easy setup and customization.
- **`assets/`**: Stores the converted `.vortex` models, keeping your project organized and versioned.

## Versioning

Model versions are systematically managed within the `.vortex` file names and stored in the `assets/` directory. This ensures that updates and iterations are easy to track and manage, promoting a smooth development cycle.
