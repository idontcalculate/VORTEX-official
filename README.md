# VORTEX-Official

**VORTEX-Official** is a streamlined Rust library designed for the conversion of machine learning models into the VORTEX format, a highly efficient and portable format optimized for seamless deployment across diverse systems. By focusing on model structure and metadata, VORTEX-Official enables the deployment of lightweight models that omit raw weights and biases, avoiding the need for cumbersome wrapper methods.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Model Conversion**: Seamlessly convert models from various formats to the VORTEX format, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.
- **Serialization**: Compact and efficient serialization for easy storage and deployment of models.
- **Custom Tensor Support**: Handle custom tensor structures, making the library flexible for specialized models.
- **Version Control**: Simplified management of model versions, ensuring that updates and iterations are tracked effectively.

## Installation

To get started with VORTEX-Official, ensure Rust is installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and build the project using Cargo, Rustâ€™s package manager. This straightforward setup ensures that you can quickly integrate VORTEX-Official into your workflow.

## Usage Overview

### Model Conversion

The core functionality of VORTEX-Official revolves around converting machine learning models into the VORTEX format. Once your model is saved in a compatible format (like a PyTorch checkpoint), you can convert it to a `.vortex` file. This file can then be used across various platforms, benefiting from its lightweight and portable nature.

### Integration and Deployment

VORTEX-Official is designed to integrate seamlessly into your existing systems, making it easier to deploy models in production environments. The generated `.vortex` files can be stored, versioned, and loaded as needed, ensuring that your deployment pipeline remains efficient and scalable.

## Project Structure

The project is organized to facilitate ease of use and extension:

- **`src/main.rs`**: The entry point of the application, coordinating the conversion process.
- **`src/convert_to_vortex.rs`**: Core logic that handles the conversion of models to the VORTEX format.
- **`src/vortex_model.rs`**: Definitions for the VortexModel and VortexLayer structs, which form the backbone of the VORTEX format.
- **`src/config.rs`**: Manages configuration, enabling easy setup and customization.
- **`assets/`**: Stores the converted `.vortex` models, keeping your project organized and versioned.

## Versioning

Model versions are systematically managed within the `.vortex` file names and stored in the `assets/` directory. This ensures that updates and iterations are easy to track and manage, promoting a smooth development cycle.
