## VORTEX

## ðŸš€ Rust-Powered Neural Networks

VORTEX Format:

A custom binary format for neural networks, storing models and allowing manipulation on binary level

Rust-Based Tensors:

I built a Tensor structure in Rust:: Itâ€™s lean, mean, and ready to process neural networks natively.

Whatâ€™s Next?

Expand VORTEX:

More layers, more features, more power. Weâ€™re making VORTEX the ultimate format for neural networks.

New Algorithms in Rust:

Write algorithms directly in Rust, optimized for performance.
Tools and Ecosystem:

Building a suite of tools for VORTEX modelsâ€”conversion, inspection, modification, all open-source.
