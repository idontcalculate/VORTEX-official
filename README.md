## VORTEX

## ðŸš€ Rust-Powered Neural Networks

VORTEX Format:

A custom binary format for neural networks, storing models efficiently and allowing manipulation without Python.
Rust-Based Tensors:

We built our own Tensor structure in Rust. Itâ€™s lean, mean, and ready to process neural networks natively.
Whatâ€™s Next?
Expand VORTEX:

More layers, more features, more power. Weâ€™re making VORTEX the ultimate format for neural networks.
New Algorithms in Rust:

Forget about Python-based frameworks. Weâ€™re writing new algorithms directly in Rust, optimized for performance.
Tools and Ecosystem:

Building a suite of tools for VORTEX modelsâ€”conversion, inspection, modification, all open-source.
