## ðŸš€ Rust-Powered Neural Networks

### Why Rust?

Why settle for Pythonâ€™s sluggish performance when you can have the speed and safety of Rust? Our project is about unlocking Rustâ€™s power to handle neural networksâ€”no PyTorch, no TensorFlow, no compromises.

### What Weâ€™ve Achieved

- **VORTEX Format:** 
  - A custom binary format for neural networks, storing models efficiently and allowing manipulation without Python.
  
- **Rust-Based Tensors:** 
  - We built our own `Tensor` structure in Rust. Itâ€™s lean, mean, and ready to process neural networks natively.
  
### Whatâ€™s Next?

- **Expand VORTEX:**
  - More layers, more features, more power. Weâ€™re making VORTEX the ultimate format for neural networks.

- **New Algorithms in Rust:**
  - Forget about Python-based frameworks. Weâ€™re writing new algorithms directly in Rust, optimized for performance.

- **Tools and Ecosystem:**
  - Building a suite of tools for VORTEX modelsâ€”conversion, inspection, modification, all open-source. 

### The Bottom Line

Rust isnâ€™t just an alternative itâ€™s the future! 
 
 Join us as we build something faster, more reliable, and truly groundbreaking.
