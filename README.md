## VORTEX-Official
VORTEX-Official is a Rust-based library designed to convert machine learning models into a highly efficient and portable VORTEX format. 
This format enables easy deployment and integration across various systems, ensuring that model structures and metadata are preserved 
without necessarily including raw weights and biases or using wrapper methods, and the models lightweight for deployment.


Features
Model Conversion: Convert models from various formats into the VORTEX format.
Serialization: Efficiently serialize models for storage and deployment.
Custom Tensor Handling: Supports custom tensor structures for specialized models.
Versioning Support: Easily manage different versions of models.
Installation
Ensure you have Rust installed. Then, clone the repository and build the project:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VORTEX-official.git
cd VORTEX-official
cargo build --release

Usage
Converting a Model
Prepare your model: Ensure your model is saved in a compatible format (e.g., PyTorch checkpoint).
Conversion: Use the provided convert_to_vortex function to convert your model.

rust

use vortex_official::{convert_to_vortex};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    convert_to_vortex("model_name", "path_to_model", "output_dir", 1)?;
    Ok(())
}
This will create a .vortex file in the specified output directory.

File Structure
src/
main.rs: Entry point for the application.
convert_to_vortex.rs: Core logic for model conversion.
vortex_model.rs: Defines the VortexModel and VortexLayer structs.
config.rs: Handles configuration loading.
assets/: Stores the converted .vortex models.
Versioning
Model versions are managed within the .vortex file name and stored in the assets/ directory. When updating a model, increment the version number to keep track of changes.
